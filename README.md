# Bowie Brain Board v1.1

![Robot Missions logo, a green leaf on a white diamond situated within a purple circle](http://robotmissions.org/images/github/robot_missions_colour_500px.png)

Bowie Brain Board is the electronics for the [Robot Missions](http://robotmissions.org) introductory robot platform, _Bowie_.

### More information about our robot platform at the [Robot Missions Website ‚ûû](http://robotmissions.org)

The Robot Missions Bowie Brain Board has ports for 6 servos, connections for 4 DC motors (2 controlled independently), can measure the current draw from the servos or DC motors, and has several connections for extendable modules. Microcontroller uses a [Teensy 3.6](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy36.html) for full functionality including data logging, or a [Teensy 3.2](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html).

Firmware can be found here: [Bowie Library](https://github.com/RobotMissions/BowieLib) and [Bowie Shoreline](https://github.com/RobotMissions/BowieShoreline).

This board was designed in gEDA. You can edit it in [pcb-rnd](http://repo.hu/projects/pcb-rnd/).

## Pinouts

There are several ways you can extend the functionality of your Bowie robot. Here are the labeled connector ports with the according pins.

> **Note:** TX_n_ denotes data out from the brain's microcontroller, and RX_n_ is data in to it.

## Schematics

For all pin usage, [see this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hbOPDjGGXycjbXXOjvf-UFxm08XbPSapu2aIzFMsICY/edit?usp=sharing). _Note: This board was designed without a schematic._

## Board Setups

### Teensy 3.6

The setup for Teensy 3.6 uses the full functionality of the brain board. Solder all of the headers on to the teensy, except for the column in the middle. Make sure the male and female pins in the middle rows line up.

### Teensy 3.2

The setup for Teensy 3.2 is a bit different. To get access to all of the servo pins and more of the GPIO, you have to solder a ribbon header out.
